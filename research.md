	- Physical layer security technique to prevent pilot contamination attack

		The pilot contamination phenomenon is seen as the bottleneck of the performance of massive MIMO, but also contains serious information security breach. We research different methods to detect the pilot contamination attack from active eavesdroppers. A simple detection method based on the transmission of random symbols from mobile terminals is proposed. As the number of receive antennas goes large, the distribution of the phase differences of received random symbols converges to a set of finite regions. Once contaminated by the active attackers, the phase difference distribution is disturbed, which is exploited to detect the existence of active attacker. In a further study, we research to use random matrix theory to characterize the distribution of the eigenvalues of the random symbols which also converges to a series of sectors. The boundary of the sectors can be determined by a theoretical way. This property is employed to detect the active attackers. 
	- Massive uplink connections in massive MIMO system

		The random access of massive concurrent Internet-of-Thing devices becomes a major challenge for the future mobile communication network. We seek the possibility of exploiting the great spatial degrees of freedom brought by the massive MIMO technique. The small-scale fading channels of concurrent users sharing the same band is converted to a scalar form after the simple Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC). The overlapped users’ symbols are then recovered using the iterative interference canceller as long as the received powers of different users exhibit significant difference. The random access of multiple concurrent users is turned into a power allocation problem. It is proved that the proposed random access scheme can support around 300% system overload ratio.

	- Proposal of a high performance PN-ZP-DMT transmission scheme

		The proposed PN-ZP-DMT scheme is based on the DMT technique and combines the advantages of PN- and ZP-based guard intervals. It employs the pseudo-noise (PN) sequences to obtain accurate channel estimation, and reduces the transmission power through the use of zero padding (ZP) guard intervals. The proposed scheme achieves a transmission data rate of 1.5 Gbps over a 50-meter experimental POF system, which represents the highest transmission rate reported in the literature.

* <U>Project Objective</U>: Proposing effective MIMO encoding and decoding algorithms for future broadcasting system
	- Proposal of a new form of the 3D MIMO codeword

		I proposed to permute the positions of information symbols so that the orthogonality is ‘concentrated’ in the first 4 information symbols. The resulting new 3D MIMO codeword is therefore fast-decodable. It is among the least complex STBCs with the same code rate and diversity. The new code is robust to the ‘near-far problem’ in distributed MIMO.
	- Proposal of a short version 3D MIMO code

		The new code has the coding rate of 2 (full-rate, 4 information symbols within 2 channel uses). It requires much less complexity than 3D MIMO code with negligible performance loss. It achieves best trade-off between performance and complexity with different channel coding configurations.
	- Proposal of a new fast-decodable DjABBA code

		The new code is full-rate, full-diversity for 4×2 MIMO transmission. It requires lowest ML decoding complexity among the fast decodable STBCs. The proposed codeword possesses highest coding gain and has best BER performance among STBCs.
	- Proposal of an ML decoders for original and new 3D MIMO codes

		The simplified decoder is realized by a four-level tree-search followed by four parallel decisions, yielding a complexity order of 4:5. It provides the ML performance and requires less processing time than the classical sphere decoder with Schnorr-Euchner enumeration.

* <U>Project Objective</U>: Proposing high performance channel estimation techniques for the PN-OFDM based systems
	- Proposal of several PN-correlation-based channel estimation techniques

		I proposed the time domain channel estimation techniques exploiting the unique correlation properties of m-sequences. I also proposed several improved estimators which reduce estimation error floor caused by the imperfect correlation results of PN sequences. The proposed PN-based channel estimation methods achieve good performance in typical channel conditions with low implementation complexity.
	- Proposal of an iterative data-aided channel estimation technique with low complexity

		I proposed an iterative data-aided channel estimation technique which is used in combination with PN-based estimation to handle the harsh channel conditions (such as the cases of SFN). In contrast to the classical ‘Turbo channel estimation’, data symbols are directly rebuilt based on the soft information output from the demapper to reduce complexity. The rebuilt ‘soft’ data symbols serve as training sequence for a second channel estimation. The data-aided channel estimation results are refined using moving average or Wienner filtering techniques. The PN-based and data-aided channel estimation results are combined according to their estimation accuracies and the resulting new channel estimation will be used to decode the information in the next iteration. The overall system performance is significantly improved with only a few iterations.
