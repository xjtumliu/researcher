## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="ml.jpg">

I received the B.Eng and M.Eng degrees from the Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU), China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively, both in Electrical Engineering. In 2011, I received the Ph.D degree in Electronical Engineering from the National Institute of Applied Sciences (INSA) in Rennes, France. I am with the Electronics and Telecommunications Institute of Rennes (IETR, UMR 6164) as a postdoctoral researcher. Since January 2015, I have been a faculty member of Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU). I'm now with the Institute of Information Communication Networks of the School of Computer & Information Technology as an Associate Professor and Ph.D. supervisor. 

My main research interests include massive MIMO, space-time coding, Turbo receiver, optical fiber communications, physical layer security and Internet of Things.
